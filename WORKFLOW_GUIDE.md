Let's say you want to change the gradient colors:

```bash
# 1. Edit index.css (change gradient colors)
# 2. Test locally
npm run dev

# 3. Commit and push

git commit -m "feat: update gradient colors to new brand palette"
git push origin main

# 4. Watch Vercel deploy automatically

```

## 🔧 **Advanced Features**

### **Branch Previews**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-design

# Make changes and push
git push origin feature/new-design
# ↑ Gets preview URL: new-design-abc123.vercel.app
```

### **Custom Domains**
- Connect your own domain
